# LaTeX Workshop

LaTeX is a typesetting system used for producing professional technical documents. This is my workspace for experimenting and scripting with said system to develop document styles that can be applied to a variety of reports, presentations, and articles. All custom LaTeX styles are consolidated within a templates directory to mitigate relocating files when switching between document formats. The repository includes an automated workflow that compiles, digitally signs, then publishes all .tex files throughout the repository. Compilation is performed via [latexmk](https://ctan.org/pkg/latexmk) which automatically adjusts the command sequence to accomodate for supplimental LaTeX modules such as glossaries and bibliographies. In the event manual compliation is required, it is recommended to begin with lualatex and add the -shell-escape option as nessesary. Special thanks to [Michael Shell](https://www.michaelshell.org) and associates for their contributions to the IEEEtran LaTeX class which serves as the foundation for several of the works presented here.
